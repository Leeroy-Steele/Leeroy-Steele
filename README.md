ðŸ˜Š Hi!

I'm Leeroy. Junior web developer & Audio Visual Engineer

I have been coding as a hobby since 2020 and I recently finished a software engineering course with AUT/ Institute of Data in 2023

I am currently working as a Product Support Specialist / QA for Lancom, NZ. My aim is to start a career as a full stack developer in the next 6 months

* Recipe-App (Fullstack NextJS App, currently deployed serverless to vercel)
* Leebay (Fullstack project similar to Ebay)
* Nelson Portable Coolrooms (freelance React front end project)
