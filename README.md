Hi there! ðŸ˜Š 

Welcome to my github. I'm a full stack web developer & AV engineer. I have been coding as a hobby since 2020 and I comleted a software engineering course with AUT/ Institute of Data in 2023. 

I am currently working as a Product Support Specialist / QA for Lancom, NZ. My aim is to start a career as a full stack developer in 2025.

**My top projects in here are**
* Recipe-App (Fullstack NextJS App, currently deployed serverless to vercel)
* Leebay (Fullstack project similar to Ebay - Was deployed to AWS but no longer live (AWS costs money!))
* Nelson Portable Coolrooms (Freelance React front end project)
* Squish the Alien (Front end fun project - browser game built with HTML, CSS and Javascript)
