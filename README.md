Hi!

I'm Leeroy. Junior web developer & Audio Visual Engineer

I have been coding as a hobby since 2020 and I recently finished a software engineering course with AUT/ Institute of Data in 2023

I am now working as an assistant trainer for Institute Of Data on their part time software engineering course

My top projects in here are 
* Leebay (Fullstack project similar to Ebay)
* Nelson Portable Coolrooms (freelance React front end project)
* Squish the Alien (Front end fun project - browser game)
* Rick and Morty Character Cards (Front End & Full stack variations)

My ambition is to land a career as a full stack developer
